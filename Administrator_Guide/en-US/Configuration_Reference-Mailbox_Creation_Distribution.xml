    <title>Mailbox Creation Distribution</title>
    <para>
        A default backend can be configured in <filename>imapd.conf</filename> with the <literal>defaultserver</literal> setting on a frontend, and a default partition can be configured with <literal>defaultpartition</literal> on a backend.
    </para>
    <para>
        Alternatively, backend or partition selection is controlled with <literal>serverlist_select_mode</literal> on the frontend and <literal>partition_select_mode</literal> on the backend.
    </para>

        <title>Selection Modes</title>
        <para>
            Selection modes configurable on frontend and backend do share the same principles. In each case, a list of available items are considered: those are the backends when creating the mailbox through a frontend, and the partitions when being on the backend. Depending on the configured selection mode, each item has an associated (disk) capacity and free space which will be used to select the most fitting one.
        </para>

            <title>Unified mupdate</title>
            <para>
                Please remember that when using a unified mupdate configuration, a server is both a frontend and a backend: you can create and access local or remote mailboxes. Since configuration settings are distinct for each role the server can take, you can apply different selection modes for each role.
